Pakistani soldiers have freed a North American family of five who were being held hostage by the Afghan Taliban.
Canadian Joshua Boyle and his US wife Caitlan Coleman were kidnapped while backpacking in Afghanistan in 2012. They had three children while in captivity.
They were rescued after a US tip-off during an operation near the Afghan border, the Pakistani army said.
US President Donald Trump said it was a "positive moment" for US-Pakistan ties.
"Ms Coleman gave birth to the couple's three children while they were in captivity," Mr Trump said in a White House statement. "Today, they are free."
He added: "The Pakistani government's co-operation is a sign that it is honouring America's wishes for it to do more to provide security in the region."
The Pakistani army said US iIntelligence agencies had been tracking the family in Afghanistan, and reported that on 11 October they had moved across the border into the Kurram tribal district of Pakistan.
